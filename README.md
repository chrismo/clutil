## Overview

A set of miscellaneous utilities for Ruby. This code was largely accumulated in my early
days of Ruby coding, back to 2001-2002. Lots of camelCased method names and a weird 
layout of things, all pre-dating things like SemVer and RubyGems. I keep it around because
I have enough projects that depend on it.

The last version of this was released before RubyForge kicked the bucket and I'm only 
updating it now perhaps for Ruby 2.0 compatibility, I'll have to see.
